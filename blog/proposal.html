                <p>
					Michigan, like many states, has a rich history of mining. In the lower peninsula, coal used to be an active commercial industry from the
					1860’s to the 1950’s. Saginaw, Shiawassee, and Tuscola counties were the main regions for this industry. While this region’s industry didn’t
					last for long due to the limited resource and low quality of the product. Even though the Michigan coal industry didn’t last as long as other
					states, it still left an impression on the state.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lots of people growing up around these areas have no idea that the main local industry used to be coal mining. Considering how close some
					of these deposits and mines are to residential areas, you’d think more people would be aware of it. That’s why it’s my goal to make this
					history more accessible to the general public.
				</p>
				<p>
					My goal is to develop an interactive map that displays the locations of coal mines and deposits in Michigan. Along with displaying the locations
					of the mines, the site will also share a detailed story of each location, including it’s construction year, information about the local area
					it’s in, and other data depending on the prominence of the mine. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Most information about the early coal industry in Michigan is found sparingly throughout outdated web entries and old maps of the state. The
					mining industry (along with timber and fishing), is an industry that helped build the foundation of why Michigan’s towns are the way that
					they are today, yet most residents don’t seem to know this. Developing a more interactive environment to display this history is a great way
					to shine light on the early years of the Michigan we know today.
